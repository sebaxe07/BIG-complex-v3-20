# Java Code Kata Project with Gradle

## Project Overview

This Java project with Gradle is designed for a Code Kata Battle, providing students with the opportunity to practice and enhance their Java programming skills. The project focuses on string manipulation with the implementation of utility functions.

## Task

### Implement the following utility functions in `src/main/java/myjavaproject/Utils.java`:
 
1. **`reverseString(String str)`**

   - Reverse a given string.

2. **`capitalizeFirstLetter(String str)`**
   - Capitalize the first letter of a given string.

### Instructions for Students:

- Open the `src/main/java/myjavaproject/Utils.java` file.
- Implement the required functions (`reverseString` and `capitalizeFirstLetter`).
- Run the provided unit tests in `test/java/myjavaproject/UtilsTest.java` to ensure your implementations are correct.

Feel free to add any additional code in `src/main/java/myjavaproject/Main.java` if needed.

### Dependencies

- Java: Make sure you have Java installed.
- Gradle: The project uses the Gradle build system.

Happy coding!
